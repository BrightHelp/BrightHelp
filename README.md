## 💡 Why BrightHelp Exists

Most VA–client relationships break down because communication is scattered across email, chat apps, spreadsheets, and random tools.

BrightHelp solves this by:

- centralizing communication  
- making tasks visible  
- keeping files organized  
- offering a simple matching system  
- supporting VAs and agencies structurally  

Structure builds clarity.  
Clarity builds trust.
